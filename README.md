The CNN Rice Leaf Detection Project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify and classify different types of diseases or pests affecting rice plants based on images of rice leaves. The project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect various conditions such as leaf blight, rust, or other common rice plant diseases, by analyzing leaf images captured in real-time. The system uses image processing and deep learning techniques to train a CNN on a large dataset of labeled rice leaf images, allowing it to learn the distinguishing features of healthy and diseased leaves.
